# Wrapped ACG (wACG) Smart Contract - Audit Report V2

## Executive Summary

This audit report covers the enhanced Wrapped ACG (wACG) smart contract deployed on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The contract has undergone significant security improvements since the initial deployment, with enhanced access controls, replay protection, and monitoring capabilities.

**Contract Address**: `0xD774b89a621C2a6595b80CE260F7165a9A7A3846`  
**Implementation**: `0xc12d5290b25Ec7132845f91f9729fB1AF92cf233`  
**Audit Date**: July 20, 2025  
**Auditor**: YesChat AI Security Analysis  
**Version**: 1.1.0

## Overall Security Rating: 🟡 **MEDIUM-HIGH**

### Key Improvements Since V1
- ✅ **Access Control Separation**: Bridge operator distinct from owner
- ✅ **Replay Protection**: `usedWrapIds` mapping prevents duplicate mints
- ✅ **Supply Control**: `maxSupply` enforced in mint operations
- ✅ **Enhanced Events**: Detailed monitoring events added
- ✅ **Fee Transparency**: Explicit fee handling in unwrap operations

## 🔍 Detailed Findings

### ✅ **RESOLVED ISSUES**

#### CF-02: Replay Attack Protection ✅ **FIXED**
**Status**: Resolved  
**Improvement**: `usedWrapIds` mapping prevents replay of same wrap request  
**Impact**: Eliminates double-spending vulnerabilities

#### CF-04: Supply Control ✅ **FIXED**
**Status**: Resolved  
**Improvement**: `maxSupply` enforced in mint() function  
**Impact**: Prevents unlimited token minting

### ⚠️ **REMAINING ISSUES**

#### CF-01: Bridge Operator Trust Model 🔴 **CRITICAL**
**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: Partially Addressed  
**Issue**: Bridge operator remains a single trusted entity with minting power

**Current State**:
- Bridge operator is separated from owner (improvement)
- Still relies on off-chain validation without multi-sig protection
- Single point of failure for minting operations

**Risk Impact**:
- Compromised bridge operator can mint unlimited tokens
- No on-chain proof validation for cross-chain deposits
- Potential for bridge operator collusion or compromise

**Recommended Mitigations**:
1. **Multi-sig Bridge Operator**: Replace single EOA with Gnosis Safe (3-of-5)
2. **Signature-based Validation**: Implement `mintWithProof()` using EIP-712 signatures
3. **Cross-chain Messaging**: Integrate with LayerZero, Axelar, or Hyperlane
4. **Validator Quorum**: Require N-of-M validator signatures for minting

**Implementation Priority**: **HIGH** - Required before production launch

#### MF-03: Fee Configuration Limitations 🟡 **MEDIUM**
**Severity**: Medium  
**Location**: `unwrap()` function  
**Issue**: Fee collector and fee amount are hardcoded at deployment

**Current Limitations**:
- No ability to update fee recipient address
- No ability to change fee amount dynamically
- Fee configuration requires contract upgrade

**Recommended Solutions**:
```solidity
function setFeeCollector(address _collector) external onlyOwner;
function setUnwrapFee(uint256 _fee) external onlyOwner;
function setWrapFee(uint256 _fee) external onlyOwner;
```

**Implementation Priority**: **MEDIUM** - Operational flexibility

#### LF-04: Independent Burn Function 🟡 **MEDIUM**
**Severity**: Medium  
**Location**: `burn()` function  
**Issue**: `burn()` can be called independently from `unwrap()` coordination

**Risk**:
- Users can burn wACG outside of unwrap process
- Bridge may not track independent burns
- Potential for untracked token destruction

**Recommended Solutions**:
1. Make `burn()` internal or protected by specific modifier
2. Add bridge-specific unwrap wrapper that logs intent
3. Implement burn tracking for bridge reconciliation

**Implementation Priority**: **MEDIUM** - Monitoring and tracking

## 🛡️ **SECURITY ASSESSMENT**

### Access Control: 🟡 **PARTIAL**
- ✅ Owner and bridge operator properly separated
- ⚠️ Bridge operator still single point of failure
- ✅ Emergency functions properly protected

### Replay Protection: ✅ **COMPLETE**
- ✅ `usedWrapIds` mapping prevents duplicate requests
- ✅ Chain ID included in request generation
- ✅ Persistent storage of processed requests

### Upgrade Safety: ✅ **COMPLETE**
- ✅ `_authorizeUpgrade` properly uses `onlyOwner`
- ✅ UUPS pattern correctly implemented
- ✅ No unauthorized upgrade vectors

### Fee Transparency: 🟢 **GOOD**
- ✅ Explicit fee deduction in unwrap operations
- ⚠️ Limited configurability (hardcoded values)
- ✅ Fee collection properly tracked

### Event Logging: ✅ **EXCELLENT**
- ✅ Comprehensive event emission
- ✅ Detailed monitoring capabilities
- ✅ Off-chain processing support

### Cross-chain Proofs: 🔴 **MISSING**
- ❌ No on-chain proof validation
- ❌ Relies entirely on off-chain trust
- ❌ No signature-based verification

### Token Economics: ✅ **CONTROLLED**
- ✅ `maxSupply` enforced
- ✅ Burn on unwrap enforced
- ✅ Daily limits implemented

### ERC20 Compliance: ✅ **VERIFIED**
- ✅ Full ERC20 standard compliance
- ✅ Proper decimals implementation
- ✅ Safe transfer operations

### Emergency Handling: 🟡 **PARTIAL**
- ✅ Pausable functionality
- ❌ No dispute resolution mechanism
- ❌ No stuck transaction recovery

### Code Quality: ✅ **CLEAN**
- ✅ Minimal dependencies
- ✅ Easy to audit
- ✅ Gas-efficient design

## 📋 **RECOMMENDATIONS**

### 🔴 **CRITICAL PRIORITY**

1. **Implement Multi-sig Bridge Operator**
   ```solidity
   // Replace single bridge operator with Gnosis Safe
   address public bridgeOperator = 0x[GNOSIS_SAFE_ADDRESS];
   ```

2. **Add Signature-based Validation**
   ```solidity
   function mintWithProof(
       address to,
       uint256 amount,
       bytes calldata signature,
       uint256 nonce
   ) external onlyBridgeOperator {
       // Verify signature from validator quorum
       // Validate cross-chain proof
       // Mint tokens
   }
   ```

### 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

3. **Implement Fee Configuration**
   ```solidity
   function setFeeCollector(address _collector) external onlyOwner;
   function setUnwrapFee(uint256 _fee) external onlyOwner;
   ```

4. **Protect Burn Function**
   ```solidity
   function burn(uint256 amount) internal onlyBridgeOperator {
       // Bridge-controlled burning only
   }
   ```

### 🟢 **LOW PRIORITY**

5. **Add Dispute Resolution**
   ```solidity
   function initiateDispute(bytes32 requestId) external;
   function resolveDispute(bytes32 requestId, bool approved) external onlyOwner;
   ```

6. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   ```solidity
   event FeeUpdated(uint256 oldFee, uint256 newFee);
   event FeeCollectorChanged(address oldCollector, address newCollector);
   ```
