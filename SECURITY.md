- **Risk**: Owner can change limits and custodian
- **Mitigation**: Owner should be a multi-sig wallet
- **Transparency**: All changes emit events

### ⚠️ Daily Limit Reset
- **Risk**: Daily limits reset at midnight UTC
- **Mitigation**: Monitor for unusual activity patterns
- **Consideration**: Time zone considerations for users

### ⚠️ Cross-Chain Dependencies
- **Risk**: Relies on ACG blockchain for proof
- **Mitigation**: Proper ACG transaction verification
- **Monitoring**: ACG blockchain health monitoring
